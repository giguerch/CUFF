1. correlation: function to produce correlation matrix. The associated
   print matrix only prints the lower triangle part of the matrix.

   percentages in one table. 
   
3. freq: frequencies of a vector or a data.frame. 

4. strutil: Series of string utility. For a more extensive set of
   functions use the stringi package.
