### String utility functions (strutil.R).
    "%+%",             # Extends the add function for strings.
    "%n%",             # Repeats s n time (usage: s %n% n)
    numtostr,          # Converts a numeric to string. Used by print methods.
### Description of continuous variables (desc.R, corr.R, mean.table.R, xf.R).
    desc,              # This function displays N, min, max, mean, sd.
    corr,              # This function compute correlation matrices and associated tests.
    means.table        # This function computes Means and SDs for each modality of a
                       # categorical variables and displays the p-value of an anova table
                       # based on that categorical variable.
    xf                 # apply a univariate function to a variable on each bin
                       # of the categorical variables on the left side of the formula.
### Description of categorical variables (freq.R, cross.R).
    freq,              # This function displays frequencies, % and % (including NA) for categorical variables.
    cross,             # This function creates a crosstab object which displays % and statistical test.
    xtab,              # Corrects bugs in xtabs associated with NA managements.
### Complementary utility functions.
    ## Print methods.
    print.desc,        # Print function for desc object.
    print.freq,        # Print function for freq objects.
    print.cross,       # Print function for freq objects.
    print.means.table, # Print function for mean.table objects.
    print.corr,        # Print function fo corr objects.
    ## sum/mean for a minimum number of valid values (sum.R and cross.R).
    sum.n,
    mean.n,
    Total,             # modification of sum that uses na.rm=TRUE as default
                       # and replaces a result of NA by 0.
    ## recode values of a variable (recode.R).
    recode,
    ## Converts dates to season from year 2012 to 2025 (season.R).
