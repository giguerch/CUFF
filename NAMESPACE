### Functions to export to users.
export(
    ## String utility functions (strutil.R).
    "%+%",             # Extends the add function for strings.
    "%n%",             # Repeats s n time (usage: s %n% n)
    numtostr,          # Converts a numeric to string. Used by print methods.
    ## Description of continuous variables (desc.R, corr.R, mean.table.R, xf.R).
    corr,              # This function compute correlation matrices
                       #  and associated tests.
    ## Description of categorical variables (freq.R, cross.R).
    cross,             # This function creates a crosstab object which
                       # displays % and statistical test.
    xtab,              # Corrects bugs in xtabs associated with NA managements.
    ## Complementary utility functions.
    ## Print methods.
    print.cross,       # Print function for freq objects.
    print.corr,        # Print function fo corr objects.
    ## sum/mean for a minimum number of valid values (sum.R and cross.R).
    Total              # modification of sum that uses na.rm=TRUE as default
                       # and replaces a result of NA by 0.
